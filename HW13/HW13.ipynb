        "- **Generates audio sample-by-sample**  \n",
        "  WaveNet treats each tiny audio sample as depending on all earlier samples, so it can create raw sound from scratch.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Uses dilated causal convolutions**  \n",
        "  Special 1-D convolutions “skip” over inputs so the network sees hundreds of milliseconds of context without needing huge filters or slow RNN loops.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gated activation + residual & skip links**  \n",
        "  A tanh × sigmoid gate inside residual blocks keeps the very deep stack stable and lets information flow straight to the output.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Soft-max over 8-bit µ-law values**  \n",
        "  16-bit samples are companded to 256 bins; a categorical soft-max models any waveform shape better than simple Gaussians.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Easy conditioning**  \n",
        "  *Global* conditioning picks a speaker or instrument; *local* conditioning adds slower signals like phonemes or pitch, guiding what the model says or plays.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Top-tier speech quality**  \n",
        "  In listening tests, WaveNet voices scored above 4 / 5 MOS and sounded more natural than LSTM or unit-selection systems.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Works beyond speech**  \n",
        "  The same network can generate music fragments or even act as a raw-audio recogniser."
